# Tor-Webserver

This is just a GUI to start or stop your server and save/delete your HTML, CSS or Javascript.

Do the following command to have the project in your local directory (User Path)
```
git clone https://github.com/JoqarSabon/tor-webserver-beta.git
```

After the folder has been copied, go into the directory with the following command.

```
cd tor-webserver-beta
```

Now you have to run the installation file with bash.

```
sudo bash install.sh
```

As a last step we start the server with bash.

```
sudo bash startlocal.sh
```
